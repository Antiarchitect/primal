//! `primal` puts raw power into prime numbers.
//!
//! This crates includes
//!
//! - optimised prime sieves
//! - checking for primality
//! - enumerating primes
//! - factorising numbers
//! - estimating upper and lower bounds for Ï€(*n*) (the number of primes
//!   below *n*) and *p<sub>k</sub>* (the <i>k</i>th prime)
//!
//! This uses a state-of-the-art cache-friendly Sieve of Eratosthenes
//! to enumerate the primes up to some fixed bound (in a memory
//! efficient manner), and then allows this cached information to be
//! used for things like enumerating and counting primes.
//!
//! `primal` takes around 2.8 seconds and less than 3MB of RAM to
//! count the exact number of primes below 10<sup>10</sup> (455052511)
//! on my laptop (i7-3517U).
//!
//! [*Source*](http://github.com/huonw/primal)
//!
//! # Using this library
//!
//! Just add the following to your [`Cargo.toml`](http://crates.io/):
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! primal = "0.2"
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Let's find the 10001st prime. The easiest way is to enumerate the
//! primes, and find the 10001st:
//!
//! ```rust
//! // (.nth is zero indexed.)
//! let p = primal::Primes::all().nth(10001 - 1).unwrap();
//! println!("The 10001st prime is {}", p); // 104743
//! ```
//!
//! This takes around 400 microseconds on my computer, which seems
//! nice and quick, but, `Primes` is flexible at the cost of
//! performance: we can make it faster. The `StreamingSieve` type
//! offers a specialised `nth_prime` function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! let p = primal::StreamingSieve::nth_prime(10001);
//! println!("The 10001st prime is {}", p); // 104743
//! ```
//!
//! This runs in only 10 microseconds! `StreamingSieve` is extremely
//! efficient and uses very little memory. It is the best way to solve
//! this task with `primal`.
//!
//! Since that was so easy, let's now make the problem bigger and
//! harder: find the sum of the 100,000th, 200,000th, 300,000th, ...,
//! 10,000,000th primes (100 in total).
//!
//! We could call `StreamingSieve::nth_prime` repeatedly:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! // the primes we want to find
//! let ns = (1..100 + 1).map(|x| x * 100_000).collect::<Vec<_>>();
//!
//! // search and sum them up
//! let sum = ns.iter()
//!             .map(|n| primal::StreamingSieve::nth_prime(*n))
//!             .fold(0, |a, b| a + b);
//! println!("the sum is {}", sum);
//! ```
//!
//! This takes around 1.6s seconds to print `the sum is 8795091674`;
//! not so speedy. Each call to `nth_prime` is individually fast (400
//! microseconds for 100,000 to 40 milliseconds for 10,000,000) but
//! they add up to something bad. Every one is starting from the start
//! and redoing work that previous calls have done... wouldn't it be
//! nice if we could just do the computation for 10,000,000 and reuse
//! that for the smaller ones?
//!
//! The `Sieve` type is a wrapper around `StreamingSieve` that
//! caches information, allowing repeated queries to be answered
//! efficiently.
//!
//! There's one hitch: `Sieve` requires a limit to know how far to
//! sieve: we need some way to find an upper bound to be guaranteed to
//! be at least as large as all our primes. We could guess that, say,
//! 10<sup>10</sup> will be large enough and use that, but that's a
//! huge overestimate (spoilers: the 10,000,000th prime is around
//! 2&times;10<sup>8</sup>). We could also try filtering with
//! exponentially larger upper bounds until we find one that works
//! (e.g. doubling each time), or, we could just take a shortcut and
//! use deeper mathematics via
//! [`estimate_nth_prime`](fn.estimate_nth_prime.html).
//!
//! ```rust
//! // the primes we want to find
//! let ns = (1..100 + 1).map(|x| x * 100_000).collect::<Vec<_>>();
//!
//! // find our upper bound
//! let (_lo, hi) = primal::estimate_nth_prime(10_000_000);
//!
//! // find the primes up to this upper bound
//! let sieve = primal::Sieve::new(hi as usize);
//!
//! // now we can efficiently sum them up
//! let sum = ns.iter()
//!             .map(|n| sieve.nth_prime(*n))
//!             .fold(0, |a, b| a + b);
//! println!("the sum is {}", sum);
//! ```
//!
//! This takes around 40 milliseconds, and gives the same output: much
//! better!
//!
//! (By the way, the version using 10<sup>10</sup> as the bound
//! instead of the more accurate estimate still only takes ~3
//! seconds.)
